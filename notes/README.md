# README.md comparison with and without markdownlint

With markdownlint enabled:

- linted.md has 51 problems (/notes/linted).

With markdownlint disabled:

- original.md has 95 problems (/README.md or /notes/original.md).

Notes: markdownlint may break some conventions to ensure compliance with special rules (similar to PEP 8). While it needs some cleaning up, it's still worth using if it can improve the overall readability of your markdown file with just one click.
